This is a repository where am going to have my codes and work done while
studying machine learning in ZOOMCAMP

* -> Homework #1

In this homework, i set up the environment and perform a few operations with numpy and pandas.

* -> Homework #2
In this homework, i trained a linear regression using my own implementation

* -> Homework #3

In this homework, i  worked with the Car price dataset. 


* -> Homework #4

In this homework, i learned about evaluating binary classification models.


* -> Homework #5

In this homework, i deployed model for the Bank credit scoring data.


* -> Homework #6
In this homework, i trained a tree-based models for regression


* -> Homework #8

In this homework, i build a model for predicting if we have an image of a bee or a wasp


* -> Homework #9

In this homework, l deployed a deep learning model with TF lite and AWS lambda
