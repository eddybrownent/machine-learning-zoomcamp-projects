Project Description

Problem Statement:

Smoking is a major public health concern, and the need for effective smoking cessation strategies is paramount. Evidence-based treatments have been proposed to aid individuals in quitting smoking, but the success rate remains relatively low, with less than one-third of participants achieving abstinence. Many healthcare professionals find counseling for smoking cessation to be ineffective and time-consuming, leading to a lack of routine implementation in daily practice. This inefficiency necessitates a more targeted approach to identify individuals with a higher likelihood of quitting smoking successfully.

The Challenge:

To address the challenge of low smoking cessation success rates, this project aims to develop a predictive model that can identify an individual's smoking status based on a set of bio-signals and health-related features. By creating such a model, we can provide a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, public health initiatives, and individuals themselves to assess the likelihood of quitting smoking.

Machine Learning Approach:

To address these challenges, l am adopting a machine learning approach to develop a predictive model. By leveraging a dataset with bio-signals and health-related features, aim to create a model that can predict whether an individual is a smoker or a non-smoker. The predictive model will provide an estimation of the likelihood of quitting smoking for each individual smoker, thereby assisting healthcare providers in identifying those who may benefit the most from smoking cessation interventions.

Outcome:

The outcome of this project will be a machine learning model that predicts smoking status based on bio-signals and health-related features. This model can be deployed for real-world applications, such as assessing smoking behavior in healthcare settings and supporting individuals on their journey to quit smoking.
